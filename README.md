# Vue Settler

A Vue 2.0 SPA starter based on the official vue webpack template. It includes the features
already available in the official vue webpack template and adds the following opinionated
set up configured out of the box:

- [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), the official router for Vue.js
- [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), the official state management solution for Vue.js
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), a promisse based http client of for the browser and node environments
- [Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus), a great language to generate CSS supporting both an indented syntax and regular CSS style.
- [LostGrid](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost), a powerful grid system built in PostCSS that works with any preprocessor and even vanilla CSS.

# Installation

This is a vue cli template so you can start using it the usual way:

```bash
vue init weavingbird/vue-settler yourapp
cd yourapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

This template is largely based on the official vue webpack full template and you can refer to the official template documentation for the inner workings and further customization as the instructions will work the same.
